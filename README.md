# Mini-project IV

### [Assignment](assignment.md)

## Project/Goals
(fill in your description and goals here)

## Hypothesis

Which applicants are more likely to get a loan?

*Possible Factors:

1. Applicants having a credit history 
2. Applicants with higher applicant and co-applicant incomes
3. Applicants with higher education level
4. Properties in urban areas with high growth perspectives
5. Applicants that apply for a lower loan amount
6. Applicants that are married
7. Applicants with 0 dependents

## EDA 

- Check to see if there are any missing values in columns
- Check categorical values & frequency in nominal variables
- Plot graphs to check data from a visual standpoint
- Use boxplot to identify outliers(if there are any)
- Add any missing values 
- Replace any string values with numerical values
- Use log transformation to get rid of extreme values
- Combine columns(ApplicantIncome, CoapplicantIncome)


## Process

- Create hypothesis 
- Import and load dataset
- Perform EDA
- Build a model
- Use pipeline on the model 
- Deploy model onto the cloud and test it


## Results/Demo
(fill in your model's performance, details about the API you created, and (optional) a link to an live demo)

## Challanges 
(discuss challenges you faced in the project)

## Future Goals
(what would you do if you had more time? are there any potential issues/biases with your model/use case?)
